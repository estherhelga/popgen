  # A simple way for a few pairs: remove the second individual from each pair.
  # WARNING: This is a simplification. If an individual appears in multiple pairs (e.g., IID1-IID2 and IID1-IID3),
  # this naive approach might not be optimal. More robust algorithms exist for complex pedigrees.
  # For a small number of independent pairs, it's usually fine.
  
  # Get unique IIDs to remove (e.g., IID2 from each pair)
  # Ensure not to add duplicates if an IID is IID2 in multiple pairs already handled by IID1.
  # A more robust way for complex scenarios involves graph-based approaches or iterative removal.
  
  # For now, let's list all unique individuals appearing as IID2 in the identified pairs
  # and then manually curate or use a more systematic approach if complex.
  # temp_removal_list <- unique(related_pairs$IID2) # A starting point

  # A practical strategy for a course project IF not too many and not too complex:
  # 1. List all unique individuals involved:
  all_related_individuals <- unique(c(related_pairs$IID1, related_pairs$IID2))
  
  # 2. Create a file `related_individuals_to_remove.txt` with FID and IID.
  #    You need to decide which one from each pair. If sample A is related to B and C,
  #    removing A might resolve both.
  #    PLINK's option to generate a maximal set of unrelated individuals is useful here, but harder to script simply.
  
  # For now, let's assume you manually inspect `related_pairs` and decide.
  # Example: if you decide to remove IID_X and IID_Y based on inspection:
  # individuals_to_remove_df <- data.frame(
  #   FID = c("FID_X", "FID_Y"), # Assuming FIDs are same as IIDs or look them up
  #   IID = c("IID_X", "IID_Y")
  # )
  # write.table(individuals_to_remove_df, "related_individuals_to_remove.txt",
  #             row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE, sep = "\t")
  # print("Manually curated list of related individuals to remove needs to be created as related_individuals_to_remove.txt")

  # A simple automated approach (less optimal but works for non-complex cases):
  # Iteratively remove individuals until no pairs above threshold remain.
  # For this example, we will just list IID2s. This is often sufficient if relationships aren't too tangled.
  # Ensure to get their FIDs too.
  
  # Create a data frame for removal
  # We need FID and IID. Assuming FID is the same as IID for this example, or you need to merge with .fam
  # For simplicity, we'll just use the IID2 from each pair for removal.
  # This is NOT ROBUST for complex networks of relatedness.
  
  # If you have many related pairs, a more systematic approach:
  # Often, one might create a list of all individuals involved and then use PLINK's
  # `--filter-related` or other tools to select a maximal set of unrelated individuals.
  # For this project, if you find related pairs:
  # 1. Note how many pairs (e.g. `related_pairs` dataframe in R).
  # 2. If it's a small number (e.g., < 5-10 distinct individuals involved),
  #    manually create `related_individuals_to_remove.txt` containing FID and IID
  #    of individuals to remove, ensuring you break all pairs > 0.1875.
  #    Prioritize removing individuals with more missing data if known.
  # Example:
  # Pair 1: A-B
  # Pair 2: C-D
  # Pair 3: A-E
  # Removal candidates: B, D, E (if A is kept). Or A, D (if B, E, C are kept).
  # Aim to remove the minimum number of individuals to break all high-IBD links.
  
  # Let's print a message to guide manual creation:
  print("ACTION REQUIRED: Inspect 'related_pairs' dataframe.")
  print("Manually create a file named 'related_individuals_to_remove.txt'.")
  print("This file should contain two columns (FID and IID, tab-separated, no header)")
  print("listing one individual from each related pair (PI_HAT > 0.1875) to be removed.")
  print("Aim to remove the minimum number of individuals to break all such relationships.")
  
  # Placeholder for the script to proceed if the file is created:
  # if (file.exists("related_individuals_to_remove.txt")) {
  #   print("related_individuals_to_remove.txt found.")
  # } else {
  #   print("related_individuals_to_remove.txt NOT found. Please create it to proceed with PLINK removal.")
