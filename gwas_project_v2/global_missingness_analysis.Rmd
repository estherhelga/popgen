# --- Making a Decision ---
# Look at the histogram:
# - Is there a large spike at F_MISS close to 0 (very well-genotyped SNPs)?
# - Are there other spikes at higher missingness values? These might represent SNPs present on fewer chips.
#   For example, if one chip covers 20% of your samples (approx 376 people), SNPs unique to that chip 
#   would have F_MISS around 0.80 (1 - 0.20).

# Look at the "SNPs Retained" plot:
# - Where does the curve start to flatten, or where do you get diminishing returns (adding many more
#   SNPs that are very highly missing)?
# - This plot helps you see the trade-off explicitly. For example, moving from --geno 0.05 to 0.10
#   might gain you X thousands of SNPs. Are those X thousands SNPs mostly missing in, say, >80% of people?
#   Or are they missing in only 6-10% of people?
