# Load the HWE statistics file
# The .hwe file can have different column sets depending on whether it's all samples,
# cases/controls, etc. We'll assume the common columns for "ALL" samples.
# PLINK's .hwe file might have leading spaces, so read.table is usually robust.
# Adjust header=TRUE and skip if needed based on your file's exact format.
# Often, the first line is a header, but sometimes it might need 'skip = X' if there are comment lines.
# It's good to manually inspect the first few lines of your .hwe file.
hwe_data <- read.table("current_cohort_hwe_stats.hwe", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, comment.char = "")

# Check the column names and first few rows
# Common columns: CHR, SNP, TEST, A1, A2, GENO, O(HET), E(HET), P
# 'P' is the HWE p-value.

# Deviations (e.g., an excess of small p-values) can indicate issues.

# --- Plot 2: Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plot of HWE p-values ---
# This is a more standard way to look at p-value distributions.
# If p-values are uniform (as expected under the null), they should fall along the y=x line.
# We expect many SNPs to conform to HWE, so most points should be on the line.
# An inflation of small p-values (points deviating upwards early) suggests widespread issues
# or true deviations.
