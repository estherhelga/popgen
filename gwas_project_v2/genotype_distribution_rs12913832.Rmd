TOP_SNP_ID <- "rs12913832"  # !! REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR ACTUAL TOP SNP ID !!

# 3. The phenotype file that was used for the GWAS on the "gwas_core_1124" individuals.
# Your PLINK command used "gwas_pheno_1196.txt". We will load this and then filter
# it to only include the individuals present in the .raw file (which are the 1124).
# OR, if you created a specific phenotype file for the 1124 individuals, use that.
# Let's assume you used gwas_pheno_1196.txt in the GWAS run.

# This is to get the exact list of 1124 individuals if needed for filtering phenotype.
