```{r}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

```

```{r}

archaic_df = read.table('ArchaicSegments.txt',
    sep='\t', header = T)

# Remove the "X" column since it is all NA
archaic_df <- archaic_df %>% select(-X)

```

```{r}

#How many individuals do we have?

num_individuals <- length(unique(archaic_df$name))
num_individuals


#How many populations do we have?

num_populations <- length(unique(archaic_df$pop))
num_populations

#How many regions are represented?

unique_regions <- unique(archaic_df$region)

```

## The lengths of Archaic fragments

### Q1. Find the total lengths of Arcahic fragments in each individual.

```{r}

# Calculate total archaic fragment lengths per individual
total_length_individual <- archaic_df %>%
    group_by(name) %>%
    summarise(TotalLength = sum(length)) %>%
    arrange(desc(TotalLength))

# View the results
head(total_length_individual)


```

### Q2. Find the total lengths of Arcahic fragments in each population.

```{r}

# Calculate total archaic fragment lengths per population
total_length_population <- archaic_df %>%
    group_by(pop) %>%
    summarise(TotalLength = sum(length)) %>%
    arrange(desc(TotalLength))

# View the top populations by total fragment length
head(total_length_population)

```

### Q3. Which population has longer fragment reads? Why?

As seen above, the population with the longest fragment reads is the Papuans. Papa new Guinea is a mart of what we know as the Malanesia region, which is known for their high amounts of archeic fragments, stemming from the Denisovans especially.

### Q4. What is the length distribution of fragments for the five different regions (hint: you can use facet_grid to plot all at once).

**The length distribution of archaic fragments across the five regions shows several key patterns:**

1.  **Left-Skewed Distribution:** All regions display a left-skewed distribution, indicating that the majority of archaic fragment lengths are relatively short, with fewer longer fragments present.

2.  **Count Differences:** There are notable differences in the total counts of fragments between regions. Melanesia and East Asia exhibit significantly higher fragment counts compared to other regions. This could be due to:

    -   A higher number of individuals sampled in these regions.

    -   A genuinely higher amount of archaic DNA present in these populations.

3.  **Consistent Distribution Shape:** Despite the count differences, the overall shape of the distributions is quite similar across regions. This consistency suggests that the mechanisms influencing the preservation and recombination of archaic fragments might be similar across diverse populations.

**What Does This Mean?**

-   The left-skewed distribution implies that most archaic fragments have undergone many recombination events over time, resulting in shorter fragments.

-   Regions with higher fragment counts, particularly Melanesia, may reflect historical factors such as reduced recombination events or a higher degree of isolation, which preserved these archaic segments over generations.

# Plotting the length distribution for each region using facet_grid
ggplot(archaic_df, aes(x = length, fill = region)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 50, alpha = 0.7) +
    facet_grid(. ~ region) +
    theme_minimal() +

         x = "Fragment Length",
         y = "Count") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

### Q5. What is the average length of fragments for each population and each region?

```{r}

# Calculate the average fragment length by population
avg_length_region <- archaic_df %>%
    group_by(region) %>%
    summarise(AverageLength = mean(length)) %>%
    arrange(desc(AverageLength))

# Calculate the average fragment length by population
avg_length_population <- archaic_df %>%
    group_by(pop) %>%
    summarise(AverageLength = mean(length)) %>%
    arrange(desc(AverageLength))

# Find the population with the longest fragment reads
longest_reads_population <- avg_length_population[1, ]
longest_reads_population


```

```{r}

options(repr.plot.width=150, repr.plot.height=10)

mean_seg_pop <- archaic_df %>%
        group_by(pop, region) %>%
        summarise(`Mean segment length` = mean(length))
  
mean_seg_pop %>%
 ungroup() %>%
  arrange(region) %>% 
    mutate(pop = factor(pop, pop)) %>%
        ggplot(aes(x = pop, y = `Mean segment length`, fill = region)) + 
            geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat="identity") + 
            theme_bw() +
            theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1),text = element_text(size=7)) 
```

```{r}

# Calculate the mean segment length by region
mean_seg_region <- archaic_df %>%
        group_by(region) %>%
        summarise(`Mean segment length` = mean(length))

# Plot the average segment length by region
ggplot(mean_seg_region, aes(x = region, y = `Mean segment length`, fill = region)) + 
    geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat="identity") + 
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1), text = element_text(size=20)) +
    labs(title = "Mean Segment Length by Region", x = "Region", y = "Mean Segment Length")


```

## The origin of archaic fragments

### Q1. For each individual, assign the archaic segments to origin and reconstruct a Figure in the same style as Figure 5 of [the Cell paper](https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30175-2#%20) 

```{r}

# Assign archaic origin based on the highest SNP count
archaic_df <- archaic_df %>%
    mutate(archaic_origin = case_when(
        Shared_with_Denisova > Shared_with_Altai & Shared_with_Denisova > Shared_with_Vindija ~ "Denisovan",
        Shared_with_Altai > Shared_with_Denisova & Shared_with_Altai > Shared_with_Vindija ~ "Neanderthal",
        Shared_with_Vindija > Shared_with_Denisova & Shared_with_Vindija > Shared_with_Altai ~ "Neanderthal",
        TRUE ~ "Unassigned"
    ))

# Calculate total archaic sequence length by individual and archaic origin
mean_length_individual <- archaic_df %>%
    group_by(name, pop, archaic_origin) %>%
    summarise(TotalLengthMb = sum(length) / 1e6) %>%
    ungroup()

# Aggregate to get mean length per population and archaic origin
mean_length_plot <- mean_length_individual %>%
    group_by(pop, archaic_origin) %>%
    summarise(MeanLengthMb = mean(TotalLengthMb)) %>%
    ungroup()

library(ggplot2)

# Plot with mean detected archaic sequence per individual by origin
ggplot(mean_length_plot, aes(x = reorder(pop, MeanLengthMb), y = MeanLengthMb, fill = archaic_origin)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
    coord_flip() +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = "Mean Detected Archaic Sequence per Individual",
         x = "",
         y = "Mean detected archaic sequence per individual (Mb)",
         fill = "Archaic Origin") +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("Neanderthal" = "lightgreen",
                                 "Denisovan" = "orange",
                                 "Unassigned" = "lightblue")) +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 10))


```

### Q2. Summarize the results by averaging over region and plot these.

```{r}

# Ensure the region is included in the summarization and compute the mean length by region
avg_length_region <- archaic_df %>%
    group_by(region, archaic_origin) %>%
    summarise(MeanLengthMb = mean(length) / 1e6) %>%  # Convert to Mb
    ungroup()

# Plotting the average length per region with region on the y-axis and average sequence length on the x-axis
ggplot(avg_length_region, aes(x = MeanLengthMb, y = reorder(region, MeanLengthMb), fill = archaic_origin)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = "Average Detected Archaic Sequence per Region",
         x = "Average detected archaic sequence per region (Mb)",
         y = "Region",
         fill = "Archaic Origin") +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("Neanderthal" = "lightgreen",
                                 "Denisovan" = "orange",
                                 "Unassigned" = "lightblue")) +
    theme(
        text = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),  # Ensure y-axis labels are readable
        plot.margin = margin(10, 10, 10, 10)    # Add some margin to avoid clipping
    )



```

## Only if time! Comparison of chromosomes

### Q1. Determine the amount of archaic introgression on each chromosome for each of the five regions.

### Q2. Repeat Q1 with assignment of archaic regions to archaic species.

### Q3. You will find that the X chromosome is an outlier (compared to a chromosome of a similar size - chr8). How and why?

### Q4. Combine the Neanderthal fragments for all individuals and plot all the fragments on top of each other along chromosomes (hint use geom_segment() and alpha = 0.02). Can you find “deserts” of archaic admixture and/or evidence for places where Neanderthal or Denisova ancestry has reached very high frequency?

### Q5. Do you find regions that are devoid of introgression for both the Neanderthal and the Denisovan admixture events?
